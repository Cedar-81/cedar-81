## Hi there 👋, I'm Divinewisdom

### About me

I started programming out of curiosity during the lockdown and I got to learn two new things about myself. I love a good ui and I love to get to the root of his things work. So I got into web development starting with JavaScript and moving on to frameworks like Nextjs and Svelte. 

With time I slowly transitioned to low-level languages like Rust which I’ve grown to love so much and Zig which I find very interesting. Having taken some time to work on various projects like [SubmergeUI](https://github.com/Cedar-81/SubmergeUI)- a library that brings tailwind-like styling to the Bevy game development world and [Dive](https://github.com/Cedar-81/dive)- a simple key-value store like Redis, I have grown to really enjoy working on the nitty-gritty stuff with Rust. 

I am currently open to work and would love to work on an environment ready to challenge me to explore even further.
